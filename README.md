# React Native Rich Text Editor with react-native-webview

> Read [original repo](https://github.com/wix/react-native-zss-rich-text-editor) first

## Inspirations

1. For now, the original library has problems of using two deprecated modules, ListView and react-native-webview-bridge-updated

2. ListView problem is solved by [Ankit-96](https://github.com/wix/react-native-zss-rich-text-editor/pull/179).

3. So I focused on removing react-native-webview-bridge-updated and making use of react-native-webview

4. Also I made new examples working on RN v0.61.5

## Limitations

* Tested on RN 0.61.5, iOS only.

* Since I worked it for my project only, I did not test it on other versions or on Android platform. If any of you are familiar with both Android and iOS natives, please refer to my project and collaborate.
